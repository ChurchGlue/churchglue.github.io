		<h1>Church Glue Open Source</h1>
		<p>
		This site is dedicated to the open source community.
		</p>
		<p>
		The vision of this project is to help Churches maintain a list of contacts, pertinent information, and keep track of attendance.
		</p>
		<p>
		Data should be readily available in useful reports.
		</p>
		<p>
		Contacts should be able to maintain their own data to eliminate the burden of data entry from the Church ministers.
		</p>
